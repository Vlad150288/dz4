R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, following The Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers. It was published in 1955. The story begins in the kingdom of Gondor, which is soon to be attacked by the Dark Lord Sauron. The volume was praised by literary figures including W. H. Auden, Anthony Price, and Michael Straight, but attacked by Edwin Muir who had praised The Fellowship of the Ring. The chapter 'The Scouring of the Shire', 'The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen', have attracted discussion by scholars and critics. 'The Scouring of the Shire' has been called the most important chapter in the whole novel, providing in its internal quest to restore the Shire a counterbalance to the main quest to destroy the Ring." },
